# Motivation

There are already many ember tabs addons but none of them are at the same time:

- Accessible
- Fully tested
- Performant
- Customizable
- Documented

This addon is a port of [react-tabs](https://github.com/reactjs/react-tabs).

Its goal is to be a standard, drop-in solution for the ember community.
